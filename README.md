Socialfield
============

The Social field module provides a single field that allows you to collect links
to multiple social networks like facebook, twitter, googleplus, linkedin, etc.

The links are presented as anchor tags with specific classes. These classes can
can be customized for each service. The classes can be used in conjunction with
icon fonts (such as fontello or font awesome) to display the links as icons.

Links entered into social fields will be validated to assure they match the
service. Validation criteria can also be customized for each service.
